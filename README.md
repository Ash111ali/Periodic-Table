# Periodic-Table
This is a small project using c language.I just tried to make something from what I learn ...in this I have written a 1 to 50 elements ...you can know the element,symbol, atomic weight and number through this ..I have used a for loop to access more than one element and just by using if and else if statements I have written this.
